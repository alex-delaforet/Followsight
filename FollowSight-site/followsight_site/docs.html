 Overview of FollowSight‚Äôs Features

 Reticle Overlay

Overlay one or more reticles (targeting guides) onto the camera preview.
	‚Ä¢	Default reticles provided: center cross, circles, framing boxes, etc.
	‚Ä¢	Reticles stay fixed on the screen unless manually repositioned.
	‚Ä¢	Only one reticle can be selected at a time.

 Import Custom Reticles
	‚Ä¢	Supported format: .png with transparency.
	‚Ä¢	Imported reticles appear alongside default ones.
	‚Ä¢	Ideal for using company-specific guides or special targets.
  ‚Ä¢ You can download a list of reticles through the Reticles pages on the app website.

 Move & Lock Reticles
	‚Ä¢	Tap and drag on the screen to move the selected reticle freely.
	‚Ä¢	Double-tap to reset to center.
	‚Ä¢	Tap the lock icon to freeze the position and avoid accidental moves.

 Resize Reticles
	‚Ä¢	Use the slide to change quickly the size of the selected reticle.
	‚Ä¢	Ideal for adapting guides to different screen distances or subject sizes.

 Zoom Camera
	‚Ä¢	Pinch with two fingers (outside a reticle) or use the second cursor to zoom in/out the live camera feed.
	‚Ä¢	Digital zoom is available up to x25, with telephoto camera on iPhone Pro models.

Zoom does not affect reticle size. Use it to refine visual aiming.


 SpotMe Setup Assistant (in collaboration with Robert Juliat)
This tool does not connect directly to SpotMe. It visually assists setup based on documented calibration procedures.
